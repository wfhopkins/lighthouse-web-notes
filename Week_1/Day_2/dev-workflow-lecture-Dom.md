### Lecture from Dom Tremblay on Dev Workflow and Git

Hey everyone,

It was nice to meet all of you! Thank you for your participation and engagement during the lecture.

In this first lecture, we covered a lot!

Incremental developement
We used the sum demo to demonstrate the incremental development approach. The step-by-step process that breaks down as follow:

State the hypothesis
Verify the hypothesis
changes
Rinse and repeat
For our sum problem, we broke down our problem into several steps without thinking about syntax. We used consol.log efficiently to validate our assumptions and see what is really happening.

Once our solution was obtained, we did refactor our code to make it more reusable and more readable.
